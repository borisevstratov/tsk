# Tiny Static Kit (TSK)

Write static HTML using JSX-style components.  
Zero runtime. Zero framework. Zero hydration.

## Why TSK?

You want a blazing-fast static site and actually enjoy writing it — reusable components, props, the good stuff?  
That’s what TSK for.

I tried Svelte, Next.js, Remix, Astro, Gatsby… bro what the fuck are these frameworks even doing?

- Install 400 dependencies?  
- Learn a new router, a new data-fetching paradigm, a new folder convention, a new religion?  
- Ship client-side JS just to render text that never changes?  
- Wait 40 seconds for dev server to restart because you finally centered a div?

It’s just a homepage, not Twitter!

**TSK**:

- Write TSX (yeah, the React syntax you already know)
- Compile to raw minified HTML
- Throw it on any host
- Done in <100 ms.

No framework. No runtime. No excuses.
